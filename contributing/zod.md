# Zod and ai-toolkit

## Background

The ai-toolkit allows users to use Zod 3, Zod 4, and Zod 4 mini schemas directly.

Incorrect internal implementations can lead to infinite recursion and OOM issues such as [#7351](https://github.com/khulnasoft/ai/issues/7351).

## Rules

For Zod 3 usage (only required in compatibility code, e.g. parsing):

- always use `import * as z3 from "zod/v3";`

For Zod 4 usage:

- always use `import * as z4 from "zod/v4";`
- always use `z4.core.$ZodType`

## Future Work

- set up linter to ensure imports are correct
